pub_HSC_Var_iband is the catalog including the effective region areas of the variable objects in the COSMOS field that get detected twice in the HSC transient survey. The effective region areas in pub_HSC_Var_iband are from i-band difference images at the epochs of 2016 Nov. 25, 2016 Nov. 29, 2016 Dec. 25, 2017 Jan. 2, 2017 Jan. 23, 2017 Jan. 30, 2017 Feb. 2, 2017 Feb. 25, 2017 Mar. 4, 2017 Mar. 23, 2017 Mar. 30, 2017 Apr. 26, and 2017 Apr. 27. For more details, please refer to Chao et al. 2021.

First column: HSC Variable ID
Second column: RA
Third column: Dec
Fourth to Sixteenth column: Effective region areas at 2016 Nov. 25, 2016 Nov. 29, 2016 Dec. 25, 2017 Jan. 2, 2017 Jan. 23, 2017 Jan. 30, 2017 Feb. 2, 2017 Feb. 25, 2017 Mar. 4, 2017 Mar. 23, 2017 Mar. 30, 2017 Apr. 26, and 2017 Apr. 27, respectively. If the value equal to -99, it means that the variable object has no i-band difference image at the corresponding epoch. 
Seventeenth Column: CHITAH \chi^2_res values (See Sec. 3.2 in Chao et al. 2021 for the detail); -99 or -99.000000 means that this object did not qualify the variability selection criteria in Chao et al. 2021, or that the CHITAH-related values are temporarily not available for this object
Eighteen Column: CHITAH \chi^2 values (See Sec. 3.2 in Chao et al. 2021 for the detail); -99 or -99.000000 means that this object did not qualify the variability selection criteria in Chao et al. 2021, or that the CHITAH-related values are temporarily not available for this object
